### Phase 6: Review and Validation
- [ ] **6.1 Internal Review**
  - [ ] Validate architecture against requirements
  - [ ] Check scalability and performance alignment
  - [ ] Review security and compliance
  - [ ] Verify technical feasibility

- [ ] **6.2 Stakeholder Review**
  - [ ] Present architecture document
  - [ ] Gather feedback and concerns
  - [ ] Make necessary revisions
  - [ ] Get final approval

## Clarification Questions

**Critical architectural decisions that need stakeholder input:**

1. **Hosting & Infrastructure:**
   - Should this be deployed on AWS (given DynamoDB requirement)? [Answer]: yes
   - Any preference for specific AWS services (EC2, Lambda, ECS, etc.)? [Answer]: Lambda
   - Should we use serverless architecture or traditional server-based? [Answer]: yes
   - Any budget constraints for infrastructure? [Answer]: no

2. **Authentication & Security:**
   - Should we implement custom authentication or use AWS Cognito? [Answer]: custom for phase 1
   - Any specific security compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)? [Answer]: none
   - Should admin and user authentication be separate systems? [Answer]: no
   - Any requirements for password policies beyond minimum 8 characters? [Answer]: 8 characters, 1 special character atleast 1 uppercase, atleast 1 lowercase

3. **Real-time Features:**
   - How should the 15-second timer be implemented (client-side, server-side, or hybrid)? [Answer]: client side
   - Should leaderboard updates be real-time or near real-time? [Answer]: near real time
   - Any requirements for handling network disconnections during quiz? [Answer]: quiz is lost or reset

4. **Image Storage & Management:**
   - Where should question images be stored (S3, local storage, CDN)? [Answer]: s3
   - Any requirements for image optimization or multiple sizes? [Answer]: none
   - Maximum image file size and supported formats beyond JPG/PNG? [Answer]: 1 Mb

5. **API Design:**
   - Should we use REST APIs, GraphQL, or a combination? [Answer]: REST
   - Any preference for API versioning strategy? [Answer]: add new endpoints when changes are done.
   - Should APIs be stateless or maintain some session state? [Answer]: stateless

6. **Database Design:**
   - Should we use single-table design or multiple tables in DynamoDB? [Answer]:  single table
   - Any requirements for data backup and retention policies? [Answer]: daily backup
   - Should we implement read replicas or global tables for performance? [Answer]: no

7. **Performance & Monitoring:**
   - What level of monitoring and logging is required? [Answer]: basic in app logging
   - Should we implement application performance monitoring (APM)? [Answer]:  no
   - Any specific metrics or alerts needed? [Answer]: slow response time for web pages. > 4 sec
   - Load testing requirements and acceptance criteria? [Answer]: none phase 1. Phase 2: load test with 1000 simutaneous users 

8. **Development & Deployment:**
   - Any preference for containerization (Docker) or direct deployment? [Answer]: direct
   - Should we implement blue-green deployment or rolling updates? [Answer]: direct
   - Any requirements for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)? [Answer]: dev, staging, prod
   - CI/CD pipeline preferences (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)? [Answer]:  Jekins

9. **Error Handling & Resilience:**
   - How should the system handle partial failures (e.g., timer fails but quiz continues)? [Answer]: quit quiz.
   - Should there be automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations? [Answer]: no
   - Any requirements for graceful degradation of features? [Answer]: none

10. **Data Consistency:**
    - How should we handle concurrent quiz sessions and leaderboard updates? [Answer]: leaderboard is generated from scores, and is eventually consistent.
    - Any requirements for eventual consistency vs strong consistency? [Answer]:  eventual consistency preferred
    - How should we handle race conditions in scoring and leaderboard? [Answer]: eventual consistency preferred

## Deliverables
1. **architecture.md** - Comprehensive system architecture document including:
   - System overview and context diagram
   - Component architecture and interactions
   - Database design and schemas
   - API specifications and contracts
   - Security architecture
   - Deployment and infrastructure design
   - Technical decisions and rationale

## Next Steps
1. **Await stakeholder review of this plan**
2. **Get answers to clarification questions**
3. **Proceed with architecture design once approved**

## Additional Minor Clarification Needed

**Just 1 quick clarification:**

1. **Jenkins CI/CD:** Do you have an existing Jenkins instance/server, or should the architecture include setting up Jenkins as part of the infrastructure?
[Answer]: will setup jenkins later. For now we will build the scripts for deployment that will be called by jenkins.
