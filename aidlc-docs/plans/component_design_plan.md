## Clarification Questions

**Critical design decisions that need stakeholder input:**

## Next Steps
1. **Await stakeholder review of this plan**
2. **Get answers to clarification questions**
3. **Proceed with component design once approved**

## Additional Minor Clarification Needed

**Just 1 quick clarification:**

1. **Component Libraries:** Your answer "yes" for reusable component libraries - should I focus on designing reusable components OR specific components? (The question had both options)
[Answer]: reusable.
