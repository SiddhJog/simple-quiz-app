# Story Generation Plan

## Project: Simple Quiz Application - User Stories & Artifacts

### Overview
Analyze requirements document and create comprehensive user personas, user stories, units of work, and dependency analysis for the quiz application.

## Plan Steps

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- [ ] **1.1 Requirements Review**
  - [ ] Read and analyze all functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-013)
  - [ ] Review non-functional requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-009)
  - [ ] Identify key user interactions and workflows
  - [ ] Map requirements to potential user roles

### Phase 2: User Personas & Roles Definition
- [ ] **2.1 Identify User Roles**
  - [ ] Define primary user roles based on requirements
  - [ ] Define admin roles and responsibilities
  - [ ] Identify any secondary or system roles

- [ ] **2.2 Create User Personas**
  - [ ] Develop detailed personas for each user role
  - [ ] Include demographics, goals, pain points, and technical proficiency
  - [ ] Create personas.md file in story-artifacts folder

### Phase 3: User Stories Creation
- [ ] **3.1 Authentication & User Management Stories**
  - [ ] Create stories for user registration (FR-001)
  - [ ] Create stories for user login (FR-002)
  - [ ] Include error handling and validation scenarios

- [ ] **3.2 Quiz Experience Stories**
  - [ ] Create stories for topic selection (FR-003, FR-004)
  - [ ] Create stories for quiz taking experience (FR-005 to FR-008)
  - [ ] Include timer functionality and question progression

- [ ] **3.3 Results & Scoring Stories**
  - [ ] Create stories for score calculation and display (FR-009, FR-010)
  - [ ] Create stories for score persistence (FR-011)
  - [ ] Create stories for leaderboard functionality (FR-012)

- [ ] **3.4 Admin Management Stories**
  - [ ] Create stories for question management (FR-013)
  - [ ] Create stories for topic management
  - [ ] Create stories for content administration

- [ ] **3.5 Non-Functional Stories**
  - [ ] Create stories for performance requirements
  - [ ] Create stories for security and usability requirements
  - [ ] Document technical constraints as acceptance criteria

- [ ] **3.6 Document User Stories**
  - [ ] Create stories.md file with all user stories
  - [ ] Include story format: As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
  - [ ] Add acceptance criteria and priority for each story

### Phase 4: Units of Work Definition
- [ ] **4.1 Group Related Stories**
  - [ ] Group authentication-related stories
  - [ ] Group quiz functionality stories
  - [ ] Group admin functionality stories
  - [ ] Group infrastructure and setup stories

- [ ] **4.2 Define Units of Work**
  - [ ] Create logical units of work with clear boundaries
  - [ ] Assign stories to appropriate units of work
  - [ ] Estimate complexity/effort for each unit
  - [ ] Create units_of_work.md file

### Phase 5: Dependency Analysis
- [ ] **5.1 Identify Dependencies**
  - [ ] Map dependencies between units of work
  - [ ] Identify prerequisite relationships
  - [ ] Consider technical dependencies (database, authentication, etc.)

- [ ] **5.2 Create Dependency Matrix**
  - [ ] Document all unit of work dependencies
  - [ ] Create visual dependency matrix
  - [ ] Identify critical path and potential bottlenecks
  - [ ] Create dependency_analysis.md file

### Phase 6: Review and Validation
- [ ] **6.1 Internal Review**
  - [ ] Review all artifacts for completeness
  - [ ] Validate stories against requirements
  - [ ] Check dependency logic and feasibility

- [ ] **6.2 Stakeholder Review**
  - [ ] Present all artifacts for review
  - [ ] Gather feedback and make revisions
  - [ ] Get final approval

## Clarification Questions

**Critical decisions that need stakeholder input:**

1. **User Personas Depth:**
   - How detailed should the user personas be? (basic demographics vs comprehensive profiles)
   - Should we include specific user scenarios and use cases?
   - Any specific target demographics to focus on for general public users?

2. **Story Granularity:**
   - What level of detail is preferred for user stories? (high-level epics vs detailed tasks)
   - Should technical stories be included or focus only on user-facing functionality?
   - How should non-functional requirements be represented in stories?

3. **Units of Work Scope:**
   - What size/complexity should each unit of work target? (sprint-sized, feature-sized, etc.)
   - Should units of work align with specific development phases or can they be mixed?
   - Any preference for frontend vs backend separation in units of work?

4. **Dependency Analysis Detail:**
   - Should the dependency analysis include technical dependencies (infrastructure, third-party services)?
   - What level of detail is needed for the dependency matrix? (high-level vs detailed task dependencies)
   - Should we include risk assessment for critical dependencies?

5. **Admin User Considerations:**
   - Should admin stories be treated as separate personas or integrated with regular user flow?
   - What level of admin functionality detail is needed beyond basic question management?
   - Should we consider different admin roles (content admin, system admin, etc.)?

6. **Story Prioritization:**
   - Should stories include MoSCoW prioritization (Must, Should, Could, Won't)?
   - How should we handle dependencies when assigning priorities?
   - Should we align story priorities with the existing requirement priorities?

## Deliverables
1. **personas.md** - User personas and roles definition
2. **stories.md** - Complete user stories with acceptance criteria
3. **units_of_work.md** - Grouped stories into logical work units
4. **dependency_analysis.md** - Dependency matrix and analysis

## Next Steps
1. **Await stakeholder review of this plan**
2. **Get answers to clarification questions**
3. **Proceed with artifact creation once approved**
