## Development Recommendations

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Start with UoW-1 (Authentication) and UoW-2 (Database/APIs)
- These are prerequisite for all other functionality

### Phase 2 (Core Functionality)
- Develop UoW-3 (Quiz Experience) and UoW-7 (Frontend) in parallel
- UoW-6 (Admin) can also be developed in parallel

### Phase 3 (Enhancement)
- Complete UoW-4 (Scoring) and UoW-5 (Leaderboard)
- Implement UoW-8 (Performance & Security) throughout all phases
